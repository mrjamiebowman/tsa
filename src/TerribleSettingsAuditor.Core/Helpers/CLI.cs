            "Sir, you’ve been standing barefoot in security humming Jimmy Buffett songs for 30 minutes. Come with us before you start grilling.",

            "Sir, you loudly explained TSA procedure to 3 people and made up 12 rules. We’re just gonna ask you to stop helping.",
            "Ma’am, your purse contains a rotisserie chicken, 3 pickles, and a whole melon. We admire your commitment to in-flight dining. Let’s chat.",
            "Sir, you’re wearing snakeskin pants, sunglasses at night, and a cape. We’re not mad — we just want a selfie and a quick bag check.",
